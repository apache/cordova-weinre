<p><span class="weinre">weinre</span> was originally designed so that each user
that wanted to use <span class="weinre">weinre</span> would run their own 
<span class="weinre">weinre</span> server.  The system has since been enhanced
to support muliple users using the same server.

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<h2>Your debug id</h2>

<p>To use a multi-user server, you'll need to select an id for yourself.  This
id will be used in the client and target URLs of <span class="weinre">weinre</span>
to scope your clients and targets from the clients and targets of other users.

<p>There is no password, just an id.  There is no real security here.  
The id is a secret shared between your
debug target and client, but it is sent in the clear when your target and
client connect to the server.  If someone else knows your <b>id</b>, they can
connect to clients or targets you are running with that <b>id</b>.

<p>So don't give your <b>id</b> to anyone else that you don't want to share 
with.

<p>To keep your <b>id</b>'s familar but non-guessable, you might use a string
consisting of your typical userid, followed by a dash, followed by another 
string not likely to be guessed by other people.

<p>If you are paranoid, you can change your <b>id</b> every time you start
a debug session, of course.

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<h2>Using your id with the client</h2>

<p>Typically when start a <span class="weinre">weinre</span> client session
by visiting a URL like 

<pre>
http://some.server.xyz/client/
</pre>

<p>To start
a client with a particular id, append the hash character (<code>#</code>) and
the id you want to use the URL.  For instance, to connect with the id 
<code>itsReallyMe</code>, launch the client with the URL 

<pre>
http://some.server.xyz/client/#itsReallyMe
</pre>

<p>The id which is used will be displayed
in the connected clients list for each connected client.

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<h2>Using your id with the target</h2>

<p>As with the server, append the hash character (<code>#</code>) to the
URL of the script being injected into your web page.  If you had previously
used a &lt;script src&gt; element of:

<pre>
&lt;script src="http://some.server.xyz/target/target-script-min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>use this script element to connect with id <code>itsReallyMe</code>

<pre>
&lt;script src="http://some.server.xyz/target/target-script-min.js#itsReallyMe"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<!-- ======================================================== -->
<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul class="spaced">

<li>The <span class="weinre">weinre</span> server always runs in multi-user
mode.  If you don't otherwise specify an <b>id</b>, the value of 
<code>anonymous</code> will be used for the <b>id</b>.

<li>The <b>id</b> is passed in the HTTP body of a POST request during the
initial connection of the target and client to the server, and is not sent
thereafter.  Thus, it should remain out of view in server logs and the like,
though it will be visible for anyone who has access to the contents of 
HTTP request bodies.

<li>There is no programmatic interface on the <span class="weinre">weinre</span>
to list <b>id</b>'s in current use, for security reasons.  From the Remote panel
of weinre, each connected client and target have their channel and id's listed,
if you can't remember what id you used with the client.

<li>The client with the Mac application currently only supports the <code>anonymous</code> id.

</ul>
